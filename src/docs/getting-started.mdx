## Install

```bash
npm install --save vaporwave-aesthetic-ui
```

## Quick Start

To get started with Vaporwave Aesthetic UI, you need to wrap the application with the `AestheticProvider` component. This provides the theme (or aesthetic in vapor wave speak üê¨ üå¥ ) to all child components.

```jsx
import React from "react";

import { AestheticProvider, Heading } from "vaporwave-aesthetic-ui";

function App() {
  return (
    <AestheticProvider>
      <Heading>App title</Heading>
      <Text>Here's some text for your application</Text>
    </AestheticProvider>
  );
}
```

If you are using React functional components, you can also access the theme from any point in the application with the `useAesthetic` hook.
