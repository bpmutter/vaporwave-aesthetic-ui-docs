The `vaporwave-aesthetic-ui` library and documentation is currently maintained by [Ben Perlmutter](https://ben.perlmutter.io).

If you'd like to contribute to the project you can reach out to Ben at [ben@perlmutter.io](mailto:ben@perlmutter.io) or get started with a pull request in the repos for the [component library](https://github.com/bpmutter/vaporwave-aesthetic-ui) and [documentation site](https://github.com/bpmutter/vaporwave-aesthetic-ui-docs).

## Project Roadmap

Here are a couple of things that are on the project roadmap for the next couple of months in no particular order.

- Complete documation site for the current component library
- Demo code to show off library features
- "Recipes" of uses of components for common things like Navigation, forms, etc.
- Fully customizable theming
- Unique customized components for forms (currently just uses ThemeUI)
- Vapor wave touches throughout the whole project with things like rainbow text, dynamic translation to Japanese, and more. The sky is really the limit here, so all creative ideas are welcome! ðŸ˜„
